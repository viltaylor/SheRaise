## 🌟 About SheRaise
SheRaise is a mobile application designed to empower women through education, skill development, career support, and mentorship. Built using Kotlin and Android Studio, the app provides a space for women to grow professionally through courses, job-seeking features, and mentoring connections.

## 🎨 Logo Meaning

The name **SheRaise** comes from _She_ (representing women) and _Raise_ (to uplift or elevate).  
The logo is designed to reflect:
- **A growing mind**: symbolizing the continuous development of women's skills and knowledge.
- **Radiating petals or rays**: representing disciplines from various professional fields.
- **Empowerment & Unity**: a modern, clean design to show strength, femininity, and connectedness.

The logo communicates the core mission of SheRaise: _to help women rise, grow, and thrive._
